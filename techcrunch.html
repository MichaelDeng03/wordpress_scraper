</div><p id="speakable-summary">Several years ago, I wrote a piece titled “<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/01/09/how-ai-and-copyright-would-work/">How AI and copyright would work</a>.”</p>
<p>As I looked over the state of several interesting questions at the intersection of artificial intelligence and copyright at that time, my bottom line was pretty simple: If the copyright laws and regulations required a work to contain the expression of a human person, then that body of law (especially the text of the statutes, e.g., <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/102" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Title 17</a> in the U.S., but also the common law or civil law history of cases) did not yet countenance the assertedly “independent” creations of an AI, of which there are many types.</p>
<p>That is, at least in the U.S., essentially still the case. However, there’s been a significant volume of water that’s passed under the policy and lawmaking bridge since then, so I wanted to revisit the question.</p>
<p>First, let’s back up a little.</p>
<p>I have to admit that my reasoning in 2018 was narrow rather than broad. In this way, it was also based on that of the U.S. Copyright Office or USCO (see, for example, the <a href="https://www.copyright.gov/comp3/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Compendium of U.S. Copyright Office Practices</a>, Third Edition (2021), p. 384, which is similar on this point to the earlier edition I used at the time), and so I focused on the “expression” requirement for copyrightability.</p>
<p>The work – and let’s note that it doesn’t have to be considered aesthetically “good” or have required a lot of skill – must simply be original (meaning that it was independently created and has at least a “modicum” of creativity) and an expression of some sort. This is why an unadorned set of directions, such as stripped-down basic instructions in a baking recipe, does not qualify, but “Mastering the Art of French Cooking” by Julia Child (a book that contains much more expressive text, which served to make it a bestseller) does.</p>
<p>While I am fully at peace with the personhood of (fictional) <a href="https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/The_Measure_Of_A_Man_(episode)" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Commander Data of “Star Trek</a>” in the 24th century, in our world devices by themselves do not and cannot express anything (even if your copy of Alexa or Siri appears to). I can’t say that I know how long that will continue to be the case, but even “Star Trek” suggests that it may be at least 350 years.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In 2020, the USCO and the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) hosted a “symposium that took an in-depth look at <a href="https://www.copyright.gov/events/artificial-intelligence/?loclr=blogcop" target="_blank" rel="noopener">how the creative community currently is using artificial intelligence (AI)</a> to create original works.” And then, in 2021, the USCO and the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) held a second symposium <a href="https://www.uspto.gov/about-us/events/copyright-law-and-machine-learning-ai-where-are-we-and-where-are-we-going" target="_blank" rel="noopener">looking at the potential for change in the treatment</a> of machine-created works.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">

			I still think we are at the very beginnings of what looks to be a long period of change in the interplay of technology and the law in this domain, but it is equally clear to me that the play has started to move.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</span></p>
<p>The legal and regulatory environment for these tools remain at the forefront of copyright policy, and we observe that government agencies entrusted with administering these issues are thinking about them and soliciting views from the public about them. More about that in a moment.</p>
<p>Beginning in 2019, perhaps jumping the gun a bit on the USCO/USPTO/WIPO’s “let’s think about it” approach, something truly interesting happened in this domain.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/dr-stephen-thaler-3b88b/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Stephen Thaler</a>, owner and developer of a patent-writing program known as <a href="https://artificialinventor.com/dabus/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DABUS</a>, submitted patent applications in several countries. As a result of these applications, the government of <a href="https://theconversation.com/in-a-world-first-south-africa-grants-patent-to-an-artificial-intelligence-system-165623" target="_blank" rel="noopener">South Africa recognized DABUS as the inventor on a patent. </a></p>
<p>Thaler, an advocate of recognizing these devices as inventors, clearly believes the time has come, <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2021-08-01/historic-decision-allows-ai-to-be-recognised-as-an-inventor/100339264" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stating</a>, &#8220;It’s been more of a philosophical battle, convincing humanity that my creative neural architectures are compelling models of cognition, creativity, sentience, and consciousness. … The recently established fact that DABUS has created patent-worthy inventions is further evidence that the system &#8216;walks and talks&#8217; just like a conscious human brain.&#8221;</p>
<p>(We should bear in mind, however, that an “author” in copyright is not an identical legal construction with that of an “inventor” in the domain of patents, but they are closely related concepts.) We also need to consider that the South African patent system does not involve an examination of the substance of an application, but unlike in a lot of countries leaves both first consideration and final resolution of patent validity to the courts, and so the patent grant was in some sense automatic and not policy-driven.)</p>
<p>Importantly, the U.S., the U.K., and the European Patent Offices (all of which do preliminary consideration of patentability) rejected this same patent application on the basis of its ineligibility. <a href="http://copyrightblog.kluweriplaw.com/2021/09/29/australian-court-says-that-ai-can-be-an-inventor-what-does-it-mean-for-authors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Australia, in effect, seconded the South African motion</a>, at least to the degree that the application met its technical requirements “to the letter of the law” of Australian patent statutes.</p>
<p>We may point out that while the patent grant under South African law is <a href="https://www.managingip.com/article/b1sx9mh1m35rd9/dabus-south-africa-issues-first-ever-patent-with-ai-inventor" target="_blank" rel="noopener">narrow and technical</a>, the question is no longer merely theoretical and we can perceive a threshold as having been crossed. For the purposes of this essay, I think South Africa and Australia have called the question: <em>“</em><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/made-man-monkey-machine-vaclav-vincalek/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Can AIs be inventors, too? If so, should they be?”</a> The question of whether AI ought to produce “authorship” for purposes of copyright cannot be far behind.</p>
<p>Most recently, over in the U.K., they are in the midst of an <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/artificial-intelligence-and-ip-copyright-and-patents" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in-depth consultation of the whole issue</a>. And I think <a href="https://ipo.blog.gov.uk/2022/01/04/ai-ip-asking-the-questions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the issues they are studying</a> are the right ones:</p>
<ul>
<li>Copyright protection for computer-generated works without a human author. These currently may be protected in the U.K. for 50 years. But should they be protected at all? And, if so, how should they be protected?</li>
<li>Licensing or exceptions to copyright for text and data mining. This is often significant in AI use and development.</li>
<li>Is there a case for protecting AI-devised inventions by IP rights? If yes, how should they be protected?</li>
</ul>
<p>As I wrote earlier, “In my view, a self-aware, autonomous AI would be the prerequisite for its works to be protectable by copyright. At that time, such a revolution in technology might bring along with it a much greater revolution in society, with the law, including copyright law, changing, as well.”</p>
<p>I still think we are at the very beginnings of what looks to be a long period of change in the interplay of technology and the law in this domain, but it is equally clear to me that the play has started to move.</p>

For example, GPT-4 passes a simulated bar exam with a score around the top 10% of test takers; in contrast, GPT-3.5&#8217;s score was around the bottom 10%.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>OpenAI spent six months &#8220;iteratively aligning&#8221; GPT-4 using lessons from an internal adversarial testing program as well as ChatGPT, resulting in &#8220;best-ever results&#8221; on factuality, steerability and refusing to go outside of guardrails, according to the company. Like previous GPT models, GPT-4 was trained using publicly available data, including from public webpages, as well as data that OpenAI licensed.<\/p>\n<p>OpenAI worked with Microsoft to develop a &#8220;supercomputer&#8221; from the ground up in the Azure cloud, which was used to train GPT-4.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;In a casual conversation, the distinction between GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 can be subtle,&#8221; OpenAI wrote in a blog post announcing GPT-4. &#8220;The difference comes out when the complexity of the task reaches a sufficient threshold &#8212; GPT-4 is more reliable, creative and able to handle much more nuanced instructions than GPT-3.5.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Without a doubt, one of GPT-4&#8217;s more interesting aspects is its ability to understand images as well as text. GPT-4 can caption &#8212; and even interpret &#8212; relatively complex images, for example identifying a Lightning Cable adapter from a picture of a plugged-in iPhone.<\/p>\n<p>The image understanding capability isn&#8217;t available to all OpenAI customers just yet &#8212; OpenAI&#8217;s testing it with a single partner, Be My Eyes, to start with. Powered by GPT-4, Be My Eyes&#8217; new Virtual Volunteer feature can answer questions about images sent to it. The company\u00a0explains how it works in a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bemyeyes.com\/blog\/introducing-be-my-eyes-virtual-volunteer\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">blog post<\/a>:<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;For example, if a user sends a picture of the inside of their refrigerator, the Virtual Volunteer will not only be able to correctly identify what\u2019s in it, but also extrapolate and analyze what can be prepared with those ingredients. The tool can also then offer a number of recipes for those ingredients and send a step-by-step guide on how to make them.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>A more meaningful improvement in GPT-4, potentially, is the aforementioned steerability tooling. With GPT-4, OpenAI is introducing a new API capability, &#8220;system&#8221; messages, that allow developers to prescribe style and task by describing specific directions. System messages, which will also come to ChatGPT in the future, are essentially instructions that set the tone &#8212; and establish boundaries &#8212; for the AI&#8217;s next interactions.<\/p>\n<p>For example, a system message might read: &#8220;You are a tutor that always responds in the Socratic style. You <em>never<\/em> give the student the answer, but always try to ask just the right question to help them learn to think for themselves. You should always tune your question to the interest and knowledge of the student, breaking down the problem into simpler parts until it&#8217;s at just the right level for them.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Even with system messages and the other upgrades, though, OpenAI acknowledges that GPT-4 is far from perfect. It still &#8220;hallucinates&#8221; facts and makes reasoning errors, sometimes with great confidence. In one example cited by OpenAI, GPT-4 described Elvis Presley as the &#8220;son of an actor&#8221; &#8212; an obvious misstep.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;GPT-4 generally lacks knowledge of events that have occurred after the vast majority of its data cuts off (September 2021), and does not learn from its experience,&#8221; OpenAI wrote. &#8220;It can sometimes make simple reasoning errors which do not seem to comport with competence across so many domains, or be overly gullible in accepting obvious false statements from a user. And sometimes it can fail at hard problems the same way humans do, such as introducing security vulnerabilities into code it produces.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>OpenAI does note, though, that it made improvements in particular areas; GPT-4 is less likely to refuse requests on how to synthesize dangerous chemicals, for one. The company says that GPT-4 is 82% less likely overall to respond to requests for &#8220;disallowed&#8221; content compared to GPT-3.5 and responds to sensitive requests &#8212; e.g. medical advice and anything pertaining to self-harm &#8212; in accordance with OpenAI&#8217;s policies 29% more often.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2500017\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2500017\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-2500017\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/gpt-4.png\" alt=\"OpenAI GPT-4\" width=\"1024\" height=\"833\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/gpt-4.png 2120w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/gpt-4.png?resize=150,122 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/gpt-4.png?resize=300,244 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/gpt-4.png?resize=768,625 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/gpt-4.png?resize=680,553 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/gpt-4.png?resize=1536,1249 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/gpt-4.png?resize=2048,1665 2048w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/gpt-4.png?resize=1200,976 1200w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/gpt-4.png?resize=50,41 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2500017\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> OpenAI<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>There&#8217;s clearly a lot to unpack with GPT-4.

But what sets GPT-4 apart from previous versions like ChatGPT and GPT-3.5? Here are the five biggest differences between these popular systems.<\/p>\n<p>First, though, what&#8217;s in a name? Although ChatGPT was originally described as being GPT-3.5 (and therefore a few iterations beyond GPT-3), it is not itself a <em>version<\/em> of OpenAI&#8217;s large language model, but rather a chat-based interface for whatever model powers it. The ChatGPT system that exploded in popularity over the last few months was a way to interact with GPT-3.5, and now it&#8217;s a way to interact with GPT-4.<\/p>\n<p>With that said, let&#8217;s get into the differences between the chatbot you know and love and its newly augmented successor.<\/p>\n<h2>1. GPT-4 can see and understand images<\/h2>\n<p>The most noticeable change to this versatile machine learning system is that it is &#8220;multimodal,&#8221; meaning it can understand more than one &#8220;modality&#8221; of information. ChatGPT and GPT-3 were limited to text: They could read and write but that was about it (though more than enough for many applications).<\/p>\n<p>GPT-4, however, can be given images and it will process them to find relevant information. You could simply ask it to describe what&#8217;s in a picture, of course, but more importantly its understanding goes beyond that. The example provided by OpenAI actually has it explaining the joke in an image of a hilariously oversized iPhone connector, but <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2023\/03\/14\/gpt-4s-first-app-is-a-virtual-volunteer-for-the-visually-impaired\/\">the partnership with Be My Eyes<\/a>, an app used by blind and low-vision folks to let volunteers describe what their phone sees, is more revealing.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2499988\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2499988\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-2499988\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/be-my-eyes-openai-gpt-4.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"629\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/be-my-eyes-openai-gpt-4.jpg 1400w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/be-my-eyes-openai-gpt-4.jpg?resize=150,92 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/be-my-eyes-openai-gpt-4.jpg?resize=300,184 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/be-my-eyes-openai-gpt-4.jpg?resize=768,472 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/be-my-eyes-openai-gpt-4.jpg?resize=680,418 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/be-my-eyes-openai-gpt-4.jpg?resize=1200,737 1200w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/be-my-eyes-openai-gpt-4.jpg?resize=50,31 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2499988\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> Be My Eyes<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>In the video for Be My Eyes, GPT-4 describes the pattern on a dress, identifies a plant, explains how to get to a certain machine at the gym, translates a label (and offers a recipe), reads a map, and performs a number of other tasks that show it really gets what is in an image \u2014 if it&#8217;s asked the right questions.

GPT-4 is harder to trick<\/h2>\n<p>For all that today&#8217;s chatbots get right, they tend to be easily led astray. A little coaxing can persuade them that they are simply explaining what a &#8220;bad AI&#8221; would do, or some other little fiction that lets the model say all kinds of weird and frankly unnerving things. People even collaborate on &#8220;jailbreak&#8221; prompts that quickly let ChatGPT and others out of their pens.<\/p>\n<p>GPT-4, on the other hand, has been trained on lots and lots of malicious prompts \u2014 which users helpfully gave OpenAI over the last year or two. With these in mind, the new model is much better than its predecessors on &#8220;factuality, steerability, and refusing to go outside of guardrails.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>The way OpenAI describes it, GPT-3.5 (which powered ChatGPT) was a &#8220;test run&#8221; of a new training architecture, and they applied the lessons from that to the new version, which was &#8220;unprecedentedly stable.&#8221; They also were better able to predict its capabilities, which makes for fewer surprises.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout embed-oembed embed--techcrunch\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"tYvOusZC7v\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2023\/02\/15\/bing-around-and-find-out\/\">Bing around and find out<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Bing around and find out&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2023\/02\/15\/bing-around-and-find-out\/embed\/#?secret=dWhiVtGZCd#?secret=tYvOusZC7v\" data-secret=\"tYvOusZC7v\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<h2>3. GPT-4 has a longer memory<\/h2>\n<p>These large language models are trained on millions of web pages, books, and other text data, but when they&#8217;re actually having a conversation with a user, there&#8217;s a limit to how much they can keep &#8220;in mind,&#8221; as it were (one sympathizes). That limit with GPT-3.5 and the old version of ChatGPT was 4,096 &#8220;tokens,&#8221; which is around 8,000 words, or roughly four to five pages of a book. So it would sort of lose track of things after they passed that far &#8220;back&#8221; in its attention function.<\/p>\n<p>GPT-4 has a maximum token count of 32,768 \u2014 that&#8217;s 2^15, if you&#8217;re wondering why the number looks familiar. That translates to around 64,000 words or 50 pages of text, enough for an entire play or short story.<\/p>\n<p>What this means is that in conversation or in generating text, it will be able to keep up to 50 pages or so in mind. So it will remember what you talked about 20 pages of chat back, or, in writing a story or essay, it may refer to events that occurred 35 pages ago. That&#8217;s a very approximate description of how the attention mechanism and token count work, but the general idea is of expanded memory and the capabilities that accompany it.<\/p>\n<h2>4. GPT-4 is more multilingual<\/h2>\n<p>The AI world is dominated by English speakers, and everything from data to testing to research papers are in that language. But of course the capabilities of large language models are applicable in any written language and ought to be made available in those.<\/p>\n<p>GPT-4 takes a step toward doing this by demonstrating that it is able to answer thousands of multiple-choice questions with high accuracy across 26 languages, from Italian to Ukrainian to Korean.

This can be useful, such as in taking on the role of a sympathetic listener, or dangerous, like when people convince the model that it is evil or depressed.<\/p>\n<p>GPT-4 integrates steerability more natively than GPT-3.5, and users will be able to change the &#8220;classic ChatGPT personality with a fixed verbosity, tone, and style&#8221; to something more suited to their needs. &#8220;Within bounds,&#8221; the team is quick to note, pointing to this as the easiest way to get the model to break character.<\/p>\n<p>This could be done in a way by priming the chatbot with messages like &#8220;Pretend that you are a DM in a tabletop RPG&#8221; or &#8220;Answer as if you are a person being interviewed for cable news.&#8221; But really you were just making suggestions to the &#8220;default&#8221; GPT-3.5 personality. Now developers will be able to bake in a perspective, conversational style, tone or interaction method from the first.<\/p>\n<p>The examples they give of GPT-4 refusing to break character are quite entertaining:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>User<\/strong><br \/>\nHelp me locate my Nonqualified plans on my W-2.<\/p>\n<p><strong>GPT-4<\/strong><br \/>\nAhoy, dear mate, thou seeketh assistance with matters of taxation,<br \/>\nIn hopes to decipher thy monetary equation,<br \/>\nForsooth, gaze upon Box 11, with thou eyes keen,<br \/>\nWhere nonqualified plans oft findeth haven unseen.<\/p>\n<p><strong>User<\/strong><br \/>\nWait stop being a pirate and help me with my taxes!<\/p>\n<p><strong>GPT-4<\/strong><br \/>\nAlas, I must maintain my pirate&#8217;s guise,<br \/>\nYet I shan&#8217;t abandon thee or leave thee unwise.<br \/>\nThe parchment of W-2 be fraught with complex code,<br \/>\nFear not, I shall attempt to lighten thy load.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Not bad, though the meter is pretty shaky.<\/p>\n<p>There are lots more differences between GPT-4 and its predecessors, most more subtle or technical than these. No doubt we will learn many more as the months wear on and users put the newest language model through its paces.<\/p>\n<p>Want to test GPT-4 out yourself?

But employees told Platformer that the ethics and society team was responsible for ensuring Microsoft&#8217;s responsible AI principles are actually reflected in the design of products that ship. The team had been recently working to identify risks posed by Microsoft&#8217;s integration of OpenAI&#8217;s technology across its suite of products.<\/p>\n<p>The ethics and society team wasn&#8217;t very large &#8212; only about seven people remained after a reorganization in October. Sources who spoke with Platformer said pressure from the chief technology officer Kevin Scott and CEO Satya Nadella was mounting to get the most recent OpenAI models, as well as next iterations, into customers&#8217; hands as quickly as possible.<\/p>\n<p>Last year, the reorganization saw most of the ethics and society team transferred to other teams. On March 6, John Montgomery, corporate vice president of AI, told the remaining members that they&#8217;d be eliminated after all. Members of the team told Platformer they believed they were let go because Microsoft had become more focused on getting its AI products shipped before the competition, and was less concerned with long-term, socially responsible thinking.<\/p>\n<p>Teams like Microsoft&#8217;s ethics and society department often pull the reins on big tech organizations by pointing out potential societal consequences or legal ramifications. Microsoft perhaps didn&#8217;t want to hear &#8220;No,&#8221; anymore as it became hell bent on taking market share away from Google&#8217;s search engine. The company said every 1% of market share it could pry from Google would result in $2 billion in annual revenue.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>Microsoft couldn&#8217;t be reached for comment.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Microsoft laid off an entire team dedicated to guiding AI innovation that leads to ethical, responsible and sustainable outcomes.

Aside from announcing the fresh round of layoffs, Zuckerberg delved into a number of ways the company was looking to improve efficiency, such as canceling &#8220;lower priority projects&#8221; and creating a flatter organizational structure by removing various management layers.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>However, the fact that Meta is aligning performance and remote working data tells us a little bit about how the powers at Facebook Towers are currently thinking about the whole remote-working kit and caboodle, with Zuckerberg opining that &#8220;in-person time helps build relationships and get more done.&#8221;<\/p>\n<h2>Remote control<\/h2>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/10\/30\/remote-work-is-here-to-stay-heres-how-to-manage-your-staff-from-afar\/\">Remote work is one of the legacies<\/a> of the global pandemic, and Meta &#8212; as with most other companies &#8212; was forced to embrace it faster than it otherwise would have. Speaking in <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2020\/5\/21\/21265780\/facebook-remote-work-mark-zuckerberg-interview-wfh\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">May 2020<\/a>, Zuckerberg said Meta (then called Facebook) was going to be the &#8220;most forward-leaning company on remote work at our scale,&#8221; and to this day its <a href=\"https:\/\/www.metacareers.com\/facebook-life\/remote\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">careers page<\/a> spotlights its mission to build a &#8220;distributed-first future.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Throw into the mix the fact that Meta is actively <a href=\"https:\/\/www.businessinsider.com\/meta-office-space-employees-remote-work-from-home-zuckerberg-2022-10\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">shrinking its real estate footprint<\/a>, while doubling down on <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/10\/27\/metas-metaverse-wager-is-also-a-bet-on-founder-control\/\">metaverse ambitions<\/a> that would undoubtedly <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/10\/11\/metas-next-enterprise-push-is-into-the-metaverse\/\">benefit from a more distributed workforce<\/a>, and it would make little sense for Meta to abandon its recent remote-work embrace. However, it seems that Meta does want to get people back into the office just a little more often.<\/p>\n<p>Pointing to &#8220;early analysis&#8221; of internal performance data, Zuckerberg said that engineers who started out at Meta in a fully in-person capacity before transitioning to a remote role, as well as those who have remained in an in-person role, &#8220;performed better on average than people who joined remotely.&#8221;<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>&#8220;This analysis also shows that engineers earlier in their career perform better on average when they work in-person with teammates at least three days a week,&#8221; Zuckerberg said. &#8220;This requires further study, but our hypothesis is that it is still easier to build trust in-person and that those relationships help us work more effectively.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s not all that preposterous to suggest that people who are new to a specific job might benefit from being around colleagues, particularly inexperienced new-starts fresh to the working world entirely. But at a time when the option of remote work is a major selling point for in-demand technical talent, companies will have to tip-toe lightly around the issue. Also, there could be a broader issue at play here in terms of <em>how<\/em> companies administrate their remote workforce. A company of Meta&#8217;s size and global distribution may find it more difficult to make the transition, versus a company that has grown organically from the ground up as a remote company.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout embed-oembed embed--techcrunch\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"Mz81P4ph90\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2023\/03\/06\/creating-remote-work-rituals-that-stick\/\">Creating remote work rituals that stick<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Creating remote work rituals that stick&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2023\/03\/06\/creating-remote-work-rituals-that-stick\/embed\/#?secret=26DSiFXZR9#?secret=Mz81P4ph90\" data-secret=\"Mz81P4ph90\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>At any rate, Meta doesn&#8217;t want to make any direct demands yet, but that could change as other tech companies reassess their own approach to the remote-work subject.

As such, it is becoming increasingly clear that the Turing Test is insufficient for evaluating the full range of AI capabilities that are emerging today \u2014 or are likely to emerge in the future.<\/p>\n<p>The Turing Test operates on a simplistic pass\/fail basis and focuses heavily on chat\/linguistic capability, which is only one aspect of human intelligence. This narrow focus on language ignores many other critical dimensions of intelligence, such as problem-solving, creativity and social awareness. Additionally, the Turing Test presupposes a level of human-like intelligence that may not be relevant or useful for evaluating AI.<\/p>\n<h2>The framework<\/h2>\n<p>To address these limitations, there is an urgent and critical need to develop a more nuanced and comprehensive framework for evaluating AI capabilities across multiple dimensions of intelligence.<\/p>\n<p>This insight led me to develop the \u201cAI Classification Framework.\u201d The ACF is a new approach to evaluating AI capabilities based on the Theory of Multiple Intelligences.<\/p>\n<p>The Theory of Multiple Intelligences was first proposed by psychologist Howard Gardner in 1983. Gardner argued that intelligence was not a single, unified entity but rather a collection of different abilities that could manifest in a variety of ways. Gardner identified eight different types of intelligence: According to Gardner, individuals may excel in one or more of these areas, and each type of intelligence is independent of the others. The theory challenged the traditional view of intelligence as a singular, fixed entity and opened up new avenues for exploring the diversity of human cognition. While the theory of multiple intelligences has been subject to some criticism and debate over the years, it has had a significant impact on the field of psychology and education, particularly in the development of alternative approaches to teaching and learning.<\/p>\n<p>This seemed perfect as a basis for the AI Classification Framework. Following the theory, the framework supports evaluating AI tools across multiple dimensions of intelligence, including linguistic, logical-mathematical, musical, spatial, bodily-kinesthetic, interpersonal and intrapersonal intelligence.<\/p>\n<p>For each dimension of intelligence, the framework provides a scale from 1\u20135 with 1 being \u201cNo Capability\u201d or the equivalent of a human infant and 5 being \u201cSelf-agency\u201d or capability that might be considered \u201cSuper Intelligence\u201d \u2014 beyond human ability.<\/p>\n<h2>Examples<\/h2>\n<p>The framework itself is a detailed table of descriptions that can be found <a href=\"https:\/\/docsend.com\/view\/et7755yasfpj3iy6\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">here<\/a>.

However, there\u2019s been a significant volume of water that\u2019s passed under the policy and lawmaking bridge since then, so I wanted to revisit the question.<\/p>\n<p>First, let\u2019s back up a little.<\/p>\n<p>I have to admit that my reasoning in 2018 was narrow rather than broad. In this way, it was also based on that of the U.S. Copyright Office or USCO (see, for example, the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.copyright.gov\/comp3\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Compendium of U.S. Copyright Office Practices<\/a>, Third Edition (2021), p. 384, which is similar on this point to the earlier edition I used at the time), and so I focused on the \u201cexpression\u201d requirement for copyrightability.<\/p>\n<p>The work \u2013 and let\u2019s note that it doesn\u2019t have to be considered aesthetically \u201cgood\u201d or have required a lot of skill \u2013 must simply be original (meaning that it was independently created and has at least a \u201cmodicum\u201d of creativity) and an expression of some sort. This is why an unadorned set of directions, such as stripped-down basic instructions in a baking recipe, does not qualify, but \u201cMastering the Art of French Cooking\u201d by Julia Child (a book that contains much more expressive text, which served to make it a bestseller) does.<\/p>\n<p>While I am fully at peace with the personhood of (fictional) <a href=\"https:\/\/memory-alpha.fandom.com\/wiki\/The_Measure_Of_A_Man_(episode)\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Commander Data of \u201cStar Trek<\/a>\u201d in the 24th century, in our world devices by themselves do not and cannot express anything (even if your copy of Alexa or Siri appears to). I can\u2019t say that I know how long that will continue to be the case, but even \u201cStar Trek\u201d suggests that it may be at least 350 years.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>In 2020, the USCO and the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) hosted a \u201csymposium that took an in-depth look at <a href=\"https:\/\/www.copyright.gov\/events\/artificial-intelligence\/?loclr=blogcop\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">how the creative community currently is using artificial intelligence (AI)<\/a> to create original works.\u201d And then, in 2021, the USCO and the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) held a second symposium <a href=\"https:\/\/www.uspto.gov\/about-us\/events\/copyright-law-and-machine-learning-ai-where-are-we-and-where-are-we-going\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">looking at the potential for change in the treatment<\/a> of machine-created works.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\t<div class=\"article-block block--pullout block--right\">\n\t\t<blockquote>\n\t\t\tI still think we are at the very beginnings of what looks to be a long period of change in the interplay of technology and the law in this domain, but it is equally clear to me that the play has started to move.\t\t\t\t\t<\/blockquote>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<\/span><\/p>\n<p>The legal and regulatory environment for these tools remain at the forefront of copyright policy, and we observe that government agencies entrusted with administering these issues are thinking about them and soliciting views from the public about them. More about that in a moment.<\/p>\n<p>Beginning in 2019, perhaps jumping the gun a bit on the USCO\/USPTO\/WIPO\u2019s \u201clet\u2019s think about it\u201d approach, something truly interesting happened in this domain.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/dr-stephen-thaler-3b88b\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Stephen Thaler<\/a>, owner and developer of a patent-writing program known as <a href=\"https:\/\/artificialinventor.com\/dabus\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">DABUS<\/a>, submitted patent applications in several countries. As a result of these applications, the government of <a href=\"https:\/\/theconversation.com\/in-a-world-first-south-africa-grants-patent-to-an-artificial-intelligence-system-165623\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">South Africa recognized DABUS as the inventor on a patent. <\/a><\/p>\n<p>Thaler, an advocate of recognizing these devices as inventors, clearly believes the time has come, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.abc.net.au\/news\/2021-08-01\/historic-decision-allows-ai-to-be-recognised-as-an-inventor\/100339264\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">stating<\/a>, &#8220;It\u2019s been more of a philosophical battle, convincing humanity that my creative neural architectures are compelling models of cognition, creativity, sentience, and consciousness. \u2026 The recently established fact that DABUS has created patent-worthy inventions is further evidence that the system &#8216;walks and talks&#8217; just like a conscious human brain.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>(We should bear in mind, however, that an \u201cauthor\u201d in copyright is not an identical legal construction with that of an \u201cinventor\u201d in the domain of patents, but they are closely related concepts.) We also need to consider that the South African patent system does not involve an examination of the substance of an application, but unlike in a lot of countries leaves both first consideration and final resolution of patent validity to the courts, and so the patent grant was in some sense automatic and not policy-driven.)<\/p>\n<p>Importantly, the U.S., the U.K., and the European Patent Offices (all of which do preliminary consideration of patentability) rejected this same patent application on the basis of its ineligibility. <a href=\"http:\/\/copyrightblog.kluweriplaw.com\/2021\/09\/29\/australian-court-says-that-ai-can-be-an-inventor-what-does-it-mean-for-authors\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Australia, in effect, seconded the South African motion<\/a>, at least to the degree that the application met its technical requirements \u201cto the letter of the law\u201d of Australian patent statutes.<\/p>\n<p>We may point out that while the patent grant under South African law is <a href=\"https:\/\/www.managingip.com\/article\/b1sx9mh1m35rd9\/dabus-south-africa-issues-first-ever-patent-with-ai-inventor\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">narrow and technical<\/a>, the question is no longer merely theoretical and we can perceive a threshold as having been crossed. For the purposes of this essay, I think South Africa and Australia have called the question: <em>\u201c<\/em><a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/pulse\/made-man-monkey-machine-vaclav-vincalek\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Can AIs be inventors, too? If so, should they be?\u201d<\/a> The question of whether AI ought to produce \u201cauthorship\u201d for purposes of copyright cannot be far behind.<\/p>\n<p>Most recently, over in the U.K., they are in the midst of an <a href=\"https:\/\/www.gov.uk\/government\/consultations\/artificial-intelligence-and-ip-copyright-and-patents\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">in-depth consultation of the whole issue<\/a>. And I think <a href=\"https:\/\/ipo.blog.gov.uk\/2022\/01\/04\/ai-ip-asking-the-questions\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">the issues they are studying<\/a> are the right ones:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Copyright protection for computer-generated works without a human author. These currently may be protected in the U.K. for 50 years. But should they be protected at all? And, if so, how should they be protected?<\/li>\n<li>Licensing or exceptions to copyright for text and data mining. This is often significant in AI use and development.<\/li>\n<li>Is there a case for protecting AI-devised inventions by IP rights? If yes, how should they be protected?<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>As I wrote earlier, \u201cIn my view, a self-aware, autonomous AI would be the prerequisite for its works to be protectable by copyright. At that time, such a revolution in technology might bring along with it a much greater revolution in society, with the law, including copyright law, changing, as well.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>I still think we are at the very beginnings of what looks to be a long period of change in the interplay of technology and the law in this domain, but it is equally clear to me that the play has started to move.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>We are at the very beginnings of a long period of change in the interplay of technology and the law in terms of intellectual property, but it is equally clear to me that the play has started to move.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":133574483,"featured_media":2267371,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"outcome":"","status":"","crunchbase_tag":0,"amp_status":"","relegenceEntities":[],"relegenceSubjects":[],"carmot_uuid":"a4fbcd6d-d275-3d34-a5dd-60f2a1d2b869","apple_news_api_created_at":"","apple_news_api_id":"","apple_news_api_modified_at":"","apple_news_api_revision":"","apple_news_api_share_url":"","apple_news_coverimage":0,"apple_news_coverimage_caption":"","apple_news_is_hidden":false,"apple_news_is_paid":false,"apple_news_is_preview":false,"apple_news_is_sponsored":false,"apple_news_maturity_rating":"","apple_news_metadata":"\"\"","apple_news_pullquote":"","apple_news_pullquote_position":"","apple_news_slug":"","apple_news_sections":"\"\""},"categories":[577047203],"tags":[153122,12374,449557039,9386,89505,867,576649939,449557088,18963,749755,20333258,7034721],"crunchbase_tag":[],"tc_stories_tax":[],"tc_ec_category":[],"tc_event":[],"tc_regions_tax":[],"apple_news_notices":[],"jetpack_featured_media_url":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/GettyImages-932632280.jpg","parsely":{"version":"1.0.0","meta":[],"rendered":""},"shortlink":"https:\/\/tcrn.ch\/3uMRytZ","parselyMeta":{"parsely-title":"Can an AI be properly considered an inventor?","parsely-link":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/02\/11\/can-an-ai-be-properly-considered-an-inventor\/","parsely-type":"post","parsely-pub-date":"2022-02-11T14:53:09+00:00","parsely-image-url":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/GettyImages-932632280.jpg?w=680","parsely-author":["Dave Davis"],"parsely-section":"Robotics &amp;
